      <t>This document aims to enrich the DOTS signal channel protocol with
      various telemetry attributes, allowing for optimal Distributed
      Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack mitigation. It specifies the normal
      traffic baseline and attack traffic telemetry attributes a DOTS client
      can convey to its DOTS server in the mitigation request, the mitigation
      status telemetry attributes a DOTS server can communicate to a DOTS
      client, and the mitigation efficacy telemetry attributes a DOTS client
      can communicate to a DOTS server. The telemetry attributes can assist
      the mitigator to choose the DDoS mitigation techniques and perform
      optimal DDoS attack mitigation.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>IT organizations and service providers are facing Distributed Denial
      of Service (DDoS) attacks that fall into two broad categories:<list
          style="numbers">
          <t>Network/Transport layer attacks target the victim's
          infrastructure. These attacks are not necessarily aimed at taking
          down the actual delivered services, but rather to prevent various
          network elements (routers, switches, firewalls, transit links, and
          so on) from serving legitimate users' traffic. <vspace
          blankLines="1" />The main method of such attacks is to send a large
          volume or high packet per second (pps) of traffic toward the
          victim's infrastructure. Typically, attack volumes may vary from a
          few 100 Mbps to 100s of Gbps or even Tbps. Attacks are commonly
          carried out leveraging botnets and attack reflectors for
          amplification attacks (Section 3.1 of <xref
          target="RFC4732"></xref>) such as NTP (Network Time Protocol), DNS
          (Domain Name System), SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), or
          SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol).</t>

          <t>Application layer attacks target various applications. Typical
          examples include attacks against HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, SIP (Session
          Initiation Protocol), or SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
          However, all applications with their port numbers open at network
          edges can be attractive attack targets. <vspace
          blankLines="1" />Application layer attacks are considered more
          complex and hard to categorize, and therefore harder to detect and
          mitigate efficiently.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>To compound the problem, attackers also leverage multi-vectored
      attacks. These attacks are assembled from dynamic attack vectors
      (Network/Application) and tactics. As such, multiple attack vectors
      formed by multiple attack types and volumes are launched simultaneously
      towards a victim. Multi-vector attacks are harder to detect and defend
      against. Multiple and simultaneous mitigation techniques are needed to
      defeat such attack campaigns. It is also common for attackers to change
      attack vectors right after a successful mitigation, burdening their
      opponents with changing their defense methods.</t>

      <t>The conclusion derived from these real scenarios is that modern
      attacks detection and mitigation are most certainly complicated and
      highly convoluted tasks. They demand a comprehensive knowledge of the
      attack attributes, the normal behavior of the targeted systems
      (including normal traffic patterns), as well as the attacker's ongoing
      and past actions. Even more challenging, retrieving all the analytics
      needed for detecting these attacks is not simple with the industry's
      current reporting capabilities.</t>

      <t>The DOTS signal channel protocol <xref target="RFC9132"></xref> is
      used to carry information about a network resource or a network (or a
      part thereof) that is under a DDoS attack. Such information is sent by a
      DOTS client to one or multiple DOTS servers so that appropriate
      mitigation actions are undertaken on traffic deemed suspicious. Various
      use cases are discussed in <xref target="RFC8903"></xref>.</t>

      <t>DOTS clients can be integrated within a DDoS attack detector, or
      network and security elements that have been actively engaged with
      ongoing attacks. The DOTS client mitigation environment determines that
      it is no longer possible or practical for it to handle these attacks
      itself. This can be due to a lack of resources or security capabilities,
      as derived from the complexities and the intensity of these attacks. In
      this circumstance, the DOTS client has invaluable knowledge about the
      actual attacks that need to be handled by its DOTS server(s). By
      enabling the DOTS client to share this comprehensive knowledge of an
      ongoing attack under specific circumstances, the DOTS server can
      drastically increase its ability to accomplish successful mitigation.
      While the attack is being handled by the mitigation resources associated
      with the DOTS server, the DOTS server has knowledge about the ongoing
      attack mitigation. The DOTS server can share this information with the
      DOTS client so that the client can better assess and evaluate the actual
      mitigation realized.</t>

      <t>DOTS clients can send mitigation hints derived from attack details to
      DOTS servers, with the full understanding that the DOTS server may
      ignore mitigation hints, as described in <xref target="RFC8612"></xref>
      (Gen-004). Mitigation hints will be transmitted across the DOTS signal
      channel, as the data channel may not be functional during an attack. How
      a DOTS server is handling normal and attack traffic attributes, and
      mitigation hints, is implementation specific.</t>

      <t>Both DOTS clients and servers can benefit from this information by
      presenting various information in relevant management, reporting, and
      portal systems.</t>

      <t>This document defines DOTS telemetry attributes that can be conveyed
      by DOTS clients to DOTS servers, and vice versa. The DOTS telemetry
      attributes are not mandatory attributes of the DOTS signal channel
      protocol <xref target="RFC9132"></xref>. Nevertheless, when DOTS
      telemetry attributes are available to a DOTS agent, and absent any
      limitation by policy, it can signal the attributes in order to optimize
      the overall mitigation service provisioned using DOTS. The
      aforementioned policy can be, for example, agreed during a service
      subscription (that is out of scope) to identify a subset of DOTS clients
      among those deployed in a DOTS client domain that are allowed to send or
      receive telemetry data.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>The reader should be familiar with the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC8612"></xref>.</t>

      <t>"DOTS Telemetry" is defined as the collection of attributes that are
      used to characterize the normal traffic baseline, attacks and their
      mitigation measures, and any related information that may help in
      enforcing countermeasures. DOTS Telemetry is an optional set of
      attributes that can be signaled in the DOTS signal channel protocol.</t>

      <t>Telemetry Setup Identifier (tsid) is an identifier that is generated
      by DOTS clients to uniquely identify DOTS telemetry setup configuration
      data.</t>

      <t>Telemetry Identifier (tmid) is an identifier that is generated by
      DOTS clients to uniquely identify DOTS telemetry data that is
      communicated prior to or during a mitigation.</t>

      <t>When two telemetry requests overlap, "overlapped" lower numeric
      'tsid' (or 'tmid') refers to the lower 'tsid' (or 'tmid') value of these
      overlapping requests.</t>

      <t>The meaning of the symbols in YANG tree diagrams are defined in <xref

    <section anchor="overview" title="DOTS Telemetry: Overview and Purpose">
      <t>Timely and effective signaling of up-to-date DDoS telemetry to all
      elements involved in the mitigation process is essential and improves
      the overall DDoS mitigation service effectiveness. Bi-directional
      feedback between DOTS agents is required for increased awareness by each
      party of the attack and mitigation efforts, supporting a superior and
      highly efficient attack mitigation service.</t>

      <section title="Need More Visibility">
        <t>When signaling a mitigation request, it is most certainly
        beneficial for DOTS clients to signal to DOTS servers any knowledge
        regarding ongoing attacks. This can happen in cases where DOTS clients
        are asking DOTS servers for support in defending against attacks that
        they have already detected and/or (partially) mitigated.</t>

        <t>If attacks are already detected and categorized within a DOTS
        client domain, the DOTS server, and its associated mitigation
        services, can proactively benefit from this information and optimize
        the overall service delivery. It is important to note that DOTS client
        domains' and DOTS server domains' detection and mitigation approaches
        can be different, and can potentially result in different results and
        attack classifications. The DDoS mitigation service treats the ongoing
        attack details received from DOTS clients as hints and cannot
        completely rely or trust the attack details conveyed by DOTS
        clients.</t>

        <t>In addition to the DOTS server directly using telemetry data as
        operational hints, the DOTS server security operation team also
        benefits from telemetry data. A basic requirement of security
        operation teams is to be aware of and get visibility into the attacks
        they need to handle. This holds especially for the case of ongoing
        attacks, where DOTS telemetry provides data about the current attack
        status. Even if some mitigation can be automated, operational teams
        can use the DOTS telemetry information to be prepared for attack
        mitigation and to assign the correct resources (operation staff,
        networking and mitigation) for the specific service. Similarly,
        security operations personnel at the DOTS client side ask for feedback
        about their requests for protection. Therefore, it is valuable for
        DOTS servers to share DOTS telemetry with DOTS clients.</t>

        <t>Mutual sharing of information is thus crucial for "closing the
        mitigation loop" between DOTS clients and servers. For the server side
        team, it is important to confirm that the same attacks that the DOTS
        server's mitigation resources are seeing are those that a DOTS client
        is asking for mitigation of. For the DOTS client side team, it is
        important to realize that the DOTS clients receive the required
        service. For example, understanding that "I asked for mitigation of
        two attacks and my DOTS server detects and mitigates only one of
        them". Cases of inconsistency in attack classification between DOTS
        clients and servers can be highlighted, and maybe handled, using the
        DOTS telemetry attributes.</t>

        <t>In addition, management and orchestration systems, at both DOTS
        client and server sides, can use DOTS telemetry as a feedback to
        automate various control and management activities derived from
        signaled telemetry information.</t>

        <t>If the DOTS server's mitigation resources have the capabilities to
        facilitate the DOTS telemetry, the DOTS server adapts its protection
        strategy and activates the required countermeasures immediately
        (automation enabled) for the sake of optimized attack mitigation
        decisions and actions. The interface from the DOTS server to the
        mitigator to signal the telemetry data is out of scope.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Enhanced Detection">
        <t>DOTS telemetry can also be used as input for determining what
        values to use for the tuning parameters available on the mitigation
        resources. During the last few years, DDoS attack detection
        technologies have evolved from threshold-based detection (that is,
        cases when all or specific parts of traffic cross a predefined
        threshold for a certain period of time is considered as an attack) to
        an "anomaly detection" approach. For the latter, it is required to
        maintain rigorous learning of "normal" behavior, and an "anomaly" (or
        an attack) is identified and categorized based on the knowledge about
        the normal behavior and a deviation from this normal behavior. Machine
        learning approaches are used such that the actual traffic thresholds
        are automatically calculated by learning the protected entity's normal
        traffic behavior during 'idle' time (i.e., no mitigation is active).
        The normal traffic characterization learned is referred to as the
        "normal traffic baseline". An attack is detected when the victim's
        actual traffic is deviating from this normal baseline pattern.</t>

        <t>In addition, subsequent activities toward mitigating an attack are
        much more challenging. The ability to distinguish legitimate traffic
        from attacker traffic on a per packet basis is complex. For example, a
        packet may look "legitimate" and no attack signature can be
        identified. The anomaly can be identified only after detailed
        statistical analysis. DDoS attack mitigators use the normal baseline
        during the mitigation of an attack to identify and categorize the
        expected appearance of a specific traffic pattern. Particularly, the
        mitigators use the normal baseline to recognize the "level of
        normality" that needs to be achieved during the various mitigation
        process.</t>

        <t>Normal baseline calculation is performed based on continuous
        learning of the normal behavior of the protected entities. The minimum
        learning period varies from hours to days and even weeks, depending on
        the protected application behavior. The baseline cannot be learned
        during active attacks because attack conditions do not characterize
        the protected entities' normal behavior.</t>

        <t>If the DOTS client has calculated the normal baseline of its
        protected entities, signaling such information to the DOTS server
        along with the attack traffic levels provides value. The DOTS server
        benefits from this telemetry by tuning its mitigation resources with
        the DOTS client's normal baseline. The DOTS server mitigators use the
        baseline to familiarize themselves with the attack victim's normal
        behavior and target the baseline as the level of normality they need
        to achieve. Fed with this information, the overall mitigation
        performances is expected to be improved in terms of time to mitigate,
        accuracy, and false-negative and false-positive rates.</t>

        <t>Mitigation of attacks without having certain knowledge of normal
        traffic can be inaccurate at best. This is especially true for
        recursive signaling (see Section 3.2.3 of <xref
        target="RFC8811"></xref>). Given that DOTS clients can be integrated
        in a highly diverse set of scenarios and use cases, this emphasizes
        the need for knowledge of each DOTS client domain behavior especially
        that common global thresholds for attack detection practically cannot
        be realized. Each DOTS client domain can have its own levels of
        traffic and normal behavior. Without facilitating normal baseline
        signaling, it may be very difficult for DOTS servers in some cases to
        detect and mitigate the attacks accurately: <list style="empty">
            <t>It is important to emphasize that it is practically impossible
            for the DOTS server's mitigators to calculate the normal baseline
            in cases where they do not have any knowledge of the traffic
            beforehand.</t>

            <t>In addition, baseline learning requires a period of time that
            cannot be afforded during active attack.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Of course, this information can provided using out-of-band
        mechanisms or manual configuration at the risk of unmaintained
        information becoming inaccurate as the network evolves and "normal"
        patterns change. The use of a dynamic and collaborative means between
        the DOTS client and server to identify and share key parameters for
        the sake of efficient DDoS protection is valuable.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Efficient Mitigation">
        <t>During a high volume attack, DOTS client pipes can be totally
        saturated. DOTS clients ask their DOTS servers to handle the attack
        upstream so that DOTS client pipes return to a reasonable load level
        (normal pattern, ideally). At this point, it is essential to ensure
        that the mitigator does not overwhelm the DOTS client pipes by sending
        back large volumes of "clean traffic", or what it believes is "clean".
        This can happen when the mitigator has not managed to detect and
        mitigate all the attacks launched towards the DOTS client domain.</t>

        <t>In this case, it can be valuable to DOTS clients to signal to DOTS
        servers the total pipe capacity, which is the level of traffic the
        DOTS client domain can absorb from its upstream network. Dynamic
        updates of the condition of pipes between DOTS agents while they are
        under a DDoS attack is essential (e.g., where multiple DOTS clients
        share the same physical connectivity pipes). It is important to note
        that the term "pipe" noted here does not necessary represent physical
        pipe, but rather represents the maximum level of traffic that the DOTS
        client domain can receive. The DOTS server should activate other
        mechanisms to ensure it does not allow the DOTS client domain's pipes
        to be saturated unintentionally. The rate-limit action defined in
        <xref target="RFC8783"></xref> is a reasonable candidate to achieve
        this objective; the DOTS client can indicate the type(s) of traffic
        (such as ICMP, UDP, TCP port number 80) it prefers to limit. The
        rate-limit action can be controlled via the signal channel <xref
        target="RFC9133"></xref> even when the pipe is overwhelmed.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Design Overview">
      <t></t>

      <section title="Overview of Telemetry Operations">
        <t>The DOTS protocol suite is divided into two logical channels: the
        signal channel <xref target="RFC9132"></xref> and data channel <xref
        target="RFC8783"></xref>. This division is due to the vastly different
        requirements placed upon the traffic they carry. The DOTS signal
        channel must remain available and usable even in the face of attack
        traffic that might, e.g., saturate one direction of the links
        involved, rendering acknowledgment-based mechanisms unreliable and
        strongly incentivizing messages to be small enough to be contained in
        a single IP packet (Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC8612"></xref>). In
        contrast, the DOTS data channel is available for high-bandwidth data
        transfer before or after an attack, using more conventional transport
        protocol techniques (Section 2.3 of <xref target="RFC8612"></xref>).
        It is generally preferable to perform advance configuration over the
        DOTS data channel, including configuring aliases for static or nearly
        static data sets such as sets of network addresses/prefixes that might
        be subject to related attacks. This design helps to optimize the use
        of the DOTS signal channel for the small messages that truly require
        reliable delivery during an attack.</t>

        <t>Telemetry information has aspects that correspond to both
        operational modes (i.e., signal and data channels): there is certainly
        a need to convey updated information about ongoing attack traffic and
        targets during an attack, so as to convey detailed information about
        mitigation status and inform updates to mitigation strategy in the
        face of adaptive attacks, but it is also useful to provide mitigation
        services with a picture of normal or "baseline" traffic towards
        potential targets, to aid in detecting when incoming traffic deviates
        from normal into being an attack. Also, one might populate a
        "database" of classifications of known types of attack so that a short
        attack identifier can be used during attack time to describe an
        observed attack. This specification does make provision for use of the
        DOTS data channel for the latter function (<xref
        target="vam"></xref>), but otherwise retains most telemetry
        functionality in the DOTS signal channel.</t>

        <t>Note that it is a functional requirement to convey information
        about ongoing attack traffic during an attack, and information about
        baseline traffic uses an essentially identical data structure that is
        naturally defined to sit next to the description of attack traffic.
        The related telemetry setup information used to parameterize actual
        traffic data is also sent over the signal channel, out of
        expediency.</t>

        <t>This document specifies an extension to the DOTS signal channel
        protocol. Considerations about how to establish, maintain, and make
        use of the DOTS signal channel are specified in <xref

        <t>Once the DOTS signal channel is established, DOTS clients that
        support the DOTS telemetry extension proceed with the telemetry setup
        configuration (e.g., measurement interval, telemetry notification
        interval, pipe capacity, normal traffic baseline) as detailed in <xref
        target="conf"></xref>. DOTS agents can then include DOTS telemetry
        attributes using the DOTS signal channel (<xref target="pre"></xref>).
        A DOTS client can use separate messages to share with its DOTS
        server(s) a set of telemetry data bound to an ongoing mitigation
        (<xref target="preCtoS"></xref>). Also, a DOTS client that is
        interested in receiving telemetry notifications related to some of its
        resources follows the procedure defined in <xref
        target="preStoC"></xref>. The DOTS client can then decide to send a
        mitigation request if the notified attack cannot be mitigated locally
        within the DOTS client domain.</t>

        <t>Aggregate DOTS telemetry data can also be included in efficacy
        update (<xref target="effu-S"></xref>) or mitigation update (<xref
        target="premStoC"></xref>) messages.</t>

        <section title="DOTS Gateways">
          <t>DOTS gateways may be located between DOTS clients and servers.
          The considerations elaborated in Section 4.4.1 of <xref
          target="RFC9132"></xref> must be followed. In particular, 'cdid'
          attribute is used to unambiguously identify a DOTS client
          domain.</t>

          <t>As a reminder, Section 4.4.1.3 of <xref target="RFC9132"></xref>

          <t>Uri-Path parameters and attributes with empty values MUST NOT be

          the entire containing message invalid.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="control" title="Controlling Configuration Data">
          <t>The DOTS server follows the same considerations discussed in
          Section of 4.5.3 of <xref target="RFC9132"></xref> for managing DOTS
          telemetry configuration freshness and notification.</t>

          <t>Likewise, a DOTS client may control the selection of
          configuration and non-configuration data nodes when sending a GET
          request by means of the 'c' Uri-Query option and following the
          procedure specified in Section of 4.4.2 of <xref
          target="RFC9132"></xref>. These considerations are not reiterated in
          the following sections.</t>

      <section title="Block-wise Transfer">
        <t>DOTS clients can use block wise transfer <xref
        target="RFC7959"></xref> with the recommendation detailed in Section
        4.4.2 of <xref target="RFC9132"></xref> to control the size of a
        response when the data to be returned does not fit within a single
        datagram.</t>

        <t>DOTS clients can also use CoAP Block1 Option in a PUT request
        (Section 2.5 of <xref target="RFC7959"></xref>) to initiate large
        transfers, but these Block1 transfers is likely to fail if the inbound
        "pipe" is running full because the transfer requires a message from
        the server for each block, which would likely be lost in the incoming
        flood. Consideration needs to be made to try to fit this PUT into a
        single transfer or to separate out the PUT into several discrete PUTs
        where each of them fits into a single packet.</t>

        <t>Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options that are similar to the CoAP Block1
        and Block2 Options, but enable robust transmissions of big blocks of
        data with less packet interchanges using NON messages, are defined in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-new-block"></xref>. DOTS implementations
        can consider the use of Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-robust-blocks"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="DOTS Multi-homing Considerations">
        <t>Multi-homed DOTS clients are assumed to follow the recommendations
        in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-multihoming"></xref> to select which
        DOTS server to contact and which IP prefixes to include in a telemetry
        message to a given peer DOTS server. For example, if each upstream
        network exposes a DOTS server and the DOTS client maintains DOTS
        channels with all of them, only the information related to prefixes
        assigned by an upstream network to the DOTS client domain will be
        signaled via the DOTS channel established with the DOTS server of that
        upstream network.</t>

        <t>Considerations related to whether (and how) a DOTS client gleans
        some telemetry information (e.g., attack details) it receives from a
        first DOTS server and share it with a second DOTS server are
        implementation and deployment specific.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="YANG Considerations">
        <t>Telemetry messages exchanged between DOTS agents are serialized
        using Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) <xref
        target="RFC8949"></xref>. CBOR-encoded payloads are used to carry
        signal-channel-specific payload messages which convey request
        parameters and response information such as errors.</t>

        <t>This document specifies a YANG module <xref
        target="RFC7950"></xref> for representing DOTS telemetry message types
        (<xref target="module"></xref>). All parameters in the payload of the
        DOTS signal channel are mapped to CBOR types as specified in <xref
        target="map1"></xref>. As a reminder, Section 3 of <xref
        target="RFC9132"></xref> defines the rules for mapping YANG-modeled
        data to CBOR.</t>

        <t>The DOTS telemetry module (<xref target="module"></xref>) is not
        intended to be used via NETCONF/RESTCONF for DOTS server management
        purposes. It serves only to provide a data model and encoding
        following <xref target="RFC8791"></xref>. Server deviations are
        strongly discouraged, as the peer DOTS agent does not have means to
        retrieve the list of deviations and thus interoperability issues are
        likely to be encountered.</t>

        <t>The DOTS telemetry module (<xref target="module"></xref>) uses
        "enumerations" rather than "identities" to define units, samples, and
        intervals because otherwise the namespace identifier
        "ietf-dots-telemetry" must be included when a telemetry attribute is
        included (e.g., in a mitigation efficacy update). The use of
        "identities" is thus suboptimal from a message compactness standpoint;
        one of the key requirements for DOTS Signal Channel messages.</t>

        <t>The DOTS telemetry module (<xref target="module"></xref>) includes
        some lists for which no key statement is included. This behavior is
        compliant with <xref target="RFC8791"></xref>. The reason for not
        including these keys is because they are not included in the request
        message body but as mandatory Uri-Paths in requests (Sections <xref
        format="counter" target="conf"></xref> and <xref format="counter"
        target="pre-t"></xref>). Otherwise, whenever a key statement is used
        in the module, the same definition as in Section 7.8.2 of <xref
        target="RFC7950"></xref> is assumed.</t>

        <t>The full tree diagram of the DOTS telemetry module can be generated
        using the "pyang" tool <xref target="PYANG"></xref>. That tree is not
        included here because it is too long (Section 3.3 of <xref
        target="RFC8340"></xref>). Instead, subtrees are provided for the
        reader's convenience.</t>

        <t>In order to optimize the data exchanged over the DOTS signal
        channel, the document specifies a second YANG module
        ("ietf-dots-mapping", <xref target="data"></xref>) that augments the
        DOTS data channel <xref target="RFC8783"></xref>. This augmentation
        can be used during 'idle' time to share the attack mapping details
        (<xref target="attackdetails"></xref>). DOTS clients can use tools,
        e.g., YANG Library <xref target="RFC8525"></xref>, to retrieve the
        list of features and deviations supported by the DOTS server over the
        data channel.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="A Note About Examples">
        <t>Examples are provided for illustration purposes. The document does
        not aim to provide a comprehensive list of message examples.</t>

        <t>The authoritative reference for validating telemetry messages
        exchanged over the DOTS signal channel are Sections <xref
        format="counter" target="conf"></xref>, <xref format="counter"
        target="pre-t"></xref>, and <xref format="counter"
        target="status"></xref> together with the mapping table established in
        <xref target="map1"></xref>. The structure of telemetry message bodies
        is represented as a YANG data structure (<xref
        target="module"></xref>).</t>

        <t>JSON encoding of YANG-modeled data is used to illustrate the
        various telemetry operations.</t>

        <t>The examples use the Enterprise Number 32473 defined for
        documentation use <xref target="RFC5612"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="Telemetry Operation Paths">
      <t>As discussed in Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC9132"></xref>, each
      DOTS operation is indicated by a path suffix that indicates the intended
      operation. The operation path is appended to the path prefix to form the
      URI used with a CoAP request to perform the desired DOTS operation. The
      following telemetry path suffixes are defined (Table 1):<figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[           +-----------------+----------------+-----------+
           | Operation       | Operation Path | Details   |

      <t>Consequently, the "ietf-dots-telemetry" YANG module defined in <xref
      target="module"></xref> defines data structure to represent new DOTS
      message types called 'telemetry-setup' and 'telemetry'. The tree
      structure is shown in <xref target="abstract"></xref>. More details are

    <section anchor="conf" title="DOTS Telemetry Setup Configuration">
      <t>In reference to <xref target="abstract"></xref>, a DOTS telemetry
      setup message MUST include only telemetry-related configuration
      parameters (<xref target="tconfig"></xref>) or information about DOTS
      client domain pipe capacity (<xref target="tpipe"></xref>) or telemetry
      traffic baseline (<xref target="tbl"></xref>). As such, requests that
      include a mix of telemetry configuration, pipe capacity, and traffic
      baseline MUST be rejected by DOTS servers with a 4.00 (Bad Request).</t>

      <t>A DOTS client can reset all installed DOTS telemetry setup
      configuration data following the considerations detailed in <xref
      target="reseta"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A DOTS server may detect conflicts when processing requests related
      to DOTS client domain pipe capacity or telemetry traffic baseline with
      requests from other DOTS clients of the same DOTS client domain. More
      details are included in <xref target="conflict"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Telemetry setup configuration is bound to a DOTS client domain. DOTS
      servers MUST NOT expect DOTS clients to send regular requests to refresh
      the telemetry setup configuration. Any available telemetry setup
      configuration has a validity timeout of the DOTS association with a DOTS
      client domain. DOTS servers MUST NOT reset 'tsid' because a session
      failed with a DOTS client. DOTS clients update their telemetry setup
      configuration upon change of a parameter that may impact attack
      mitigation.</t>

      <t>DOTS telemetry setup configuration request and response messages are
      marked as Confirmable messages (Section 2.1 of <xref
      target="RFC7252"></xref>).</t>

      <section anchor="tconfig" title="Telemetry Configuration">
        <t>DOTS telemetry uses several percentile values to provide a picture
        of a traffic distribution overall, as opposed to just a single
        snapshot of observed traffic at a single point in time. Modeling raw
        traffic flow data as a distribution and describing that distribution
        entails choosing a measurement period that the distribution will
        describe, and a number of sampling intervals, or "buckets", within
        that measurement period. Traffic within each bucket is treated as a
        single event (i.e., averaged), and then the distribution of buckets is
        used to describe the distribution of traffic over the measurement
        period. A distribution can be characterized by statistical measures
        such as mean, median, and standard deviation, and also by reporting
        the value of the distribution at various percentile levels of the data
        set in question, such as "quartiles" that correspond to 25th, 50th,
        and 75th percentile. More details about percentile values and their
        computation are found in Section 11.3 of <xref
        target="RFC2330"></xref>.</t>

        <t>DOTS telemetry uses up to three percentile values, plus the overall
        peak, to characterize traffic distributions. Which percentile
        thresholds are used for these "low", "medium", and "high" percentile
        values is configurable (with suitable defaults).</t>

        <t>A DOTS client can negotiate with its server(s) a set of telemetry
        configuration parameters to be used for telemetry. Such parameters
        include:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Percentile-related measurement parameters. In particular,
            'measurement-interval' defines the period on which percentiles are
            computed, while 'measurement-sample' defines the time distribution
            for measuring values that are used to compute percentiles.</t>

        <section anchor="acc"
                 title="Retrieve Current DOTS Telemetry Configuration">
          <t>A GET request is used to obtain acceptable and current telemetry
          configuration parameters on the DOTS server. This request may
          include a 'cdid' Uri-Path when the request is relayed by a DOTS
          gateway. An example of such a GET request (without gateway) is

          <t>Upon receipt of such a request, and assuming no error is
          encountered when processing the request, the DOTS server replies
          with a 2.05 (Content) response that conveys the telemetry parameters

          <t>By default, low percentile (10th percentile), mid percentile
          (50th percentile), high percentile (90th percentile), and peak
          (100th percentile) values are used to represent telemetry data.
          Nevertheless, a DOTS client can disable some percentile types (low,
          mid, high). In particular, setting 'low-percentile' to '0.00'
          indicates that the DOTS client is not interested in receiving
          low-percentiles. Likewise, setting 'mid-percentile' (or
          'high-percentile') to the same value as 'low-percentile' (or
          'mid-percentile') indicates that the DOTS client is not interested
          in receiving mid-percentiles (or high-percentiles). For example, a
          DOTS client can send the request depicted in <xref
          target="tput1"></xref> to inform the server that it is interested in
          receiving only high-percentiles. This assumes that the client will
          only use that percentile type when sharing telemetry data with the
          server.</t>

        <t>A DOTS client domain pipe is defined as a list of limits of
        (incoming) traffic volume ('total-pipe-capacity') that can be
        forwarded over ingress interconnection links of a DOTS client domain.
        Each of these links is identified with a 'link-id' <xref
        target="RFC8345"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The unit used by a DOTS client when conveying pipe information is
        captured in the 'unit' attribute. The DOTS client MUST auto-scale so
        that the appropriate unit is used. That is, for a given unit class,
        the DOTS client uses the largest unit that gives a value greater than
        one.</t>

        <section title="Conveying DOTS Client Domain Pipe Capacity">
          <t>Similar considerations to those specified in <xref
          target="PUT"></xref> are followed with one exception:<list
              style="empty">
              <t>The relative order of two PUT requests carrying DOTS client
              domain pipe attributes from a DOTS client is determined by
              comparing their respective 'tsid' values. If such two requests
              have overlapping 'link-id' and 'unit', the PUT request with
              higher numeric 'tsid' value will override the request with a
              lower numeric 'tsid' value. The overlapped lower numeric 'tsid'
              MUST be automatically deleted and no longer be available.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>DOTS clients SHOULD minimize the number of active 'tsid's used
          for pipe information. In order to avoid maintaining a long list of
          'tsid's for pipe information, it is RECOMMENDED that DOTS clients
          include in any request to update information related to a given link
          the information of other links (already communicated using a lower
          'tsid' value). Doing so, this update request will override these
          existing requests and hence optimize the number of 'tsid' request
          per DOTS client. <list style="symbols">

          the same DOTS client domain (see <xref target="pdel"></xref> for
          other delete cases). For example, if a DOTS client domain re-homes
          (that is, it changes its ISP), the DOTS client can inform its DOTS
          server about this update (e.g., from the network configuration in
          <xref target="single"></xref> to the one shown in <xref
          target="single2"></xref>) by sending the PUT request depicted in
          <xref target="putp3"></xref>. Upon receipt of this request, and
          assuming no error is encountered when processing the request, the
          DOTS server removes "link1" from its configuration bases for this
          DOTS client domain. Note that if the DOTS server receives a PUT
          request with a 'capacity' attribute set to "0" for all included
          links, it MUST reject the request with a 4.00 (Bad Request).</t>

        <t>A DOTS client can share one or multiple normal traffic baselines
        (e.g., aggregate or per-prefix baselines), each are uniquely
        identified within the DOTS client domain with an identifier 'id'. This
        identifier can be used to update a baseline entry, delete a specific
        entry, etc.</t>

        <section title="Conveying DOTS Client Domain Baseline Information">
          <t>Similar considerations to those specified in <xref
          target="PUT"></xref> are followed with one exception:<list
              style="empty">
              <t>The relative order of two PUT requests carrying DOTS client
              domain baseline attributes from a DOTS client is determined by
              comparing their respective 'tsid' values. If such two requests
              have overlapping targets, the PUT request with higher numeric
              'tsid' value will override the request with a lower numeric
              'tsid' value. The overlapped lower numeric 'tsid' MUST be
              automatically deleted and no longer be available.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Two PUT requests from a DOTS client have overlapping targets if
          there is a common IP address, IP prefix, FQDN, URI, or alias-name.
          Also, two PUT requests from a DOTS client have overlapping targets
          from the perspective of the DOTS server if the addresses associated
          with the FQDN, URI, or alias are overlapping with each other or with
          'target-prefix'.</t>

          <t>DOTS clients SHOULD minimize the number of active 'tsid's used
          for baseline information. In order to avoid maintaining a long list
          of 'tsid's for baseline information, it is RECOMMENDED that DOTS
          clients include in a request to update information related to a
          given target, the information of other targets (already communicated
          using a lower 'tsid' value) (assuming this fits within one single
          datagram). This update request will override these existing requests
          and hence optimize the number of 'tsid' request per DOTS client.</t>

          <t>If no target attribute is included in the request, this is an
          indication that the baseline information applies for the DOTS client
          domain as a whole.</t>

          <t>An example of a PUT request to convey the baseline information is
          shown in <xref target="tputs"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="pre-t" title="DOTS Pre-or-Ongoing Mitigation Telemetry">
      <t>There are two broad types of DDoS attacks: one is a bandwidth
      consuming attack, the other is a target-resource-consuming attack. This
      section outlines the set of DOTS telemetry attributes (<xref
      target="pre"></xref>) that covers both types of attack. The objective of
      these attributes is to allow for the complete knowledge of attacks and
      the various particulars that can best characterize attacks.</t>

      <t>The "ietf-dots-telemetry" YANG module (<xref target="module"></xref>)
      defines the data structure of a new message type called 'telemetry'. The
      tree structure of the 'telemetry' message type is shown in <xref
      target="tt"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry attributes are indicated by
      the path suffix '/tm'. The '/tm' is appended to the path prefix to form
      the URI used with a CoAP request to signal the DOTS telemetry.
      Pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry attributes specified in <xref
      target="pre"></xref> can be signaled between DOTS agents.</t>

      <t>Pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry attributes may be sent by a DOTS
      client or a DOTS server.</t>

      <t>DOTS agents SHOULD bind pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry data to
      mitigation requests associated with the resources under attack. In
      particular, a telemetry PUT request sent after a mitigation request may
      include a reference to that mitigation request ('mid-list') as shown in
      <xref target="mid-co"></xref>. An example illustrating request
      correlation by means of 'target-prefix' is shown in <xref
      target="mid-co2"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Many of the pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry data use a unit that
      falls under the unit class that is configured following the procedure
      described in <xref target="PUT"></xref>. When generating telemetry data
      to send to a peer, the DOTS agent MUST auto-scale so that appropriate
      unit(s) are used.</t>

          <t>This attribute (depicted in <xref target="adt"></xref>) is used
          to signal a set of details characterizing an attack. The following
          subattributes describing the ongoing attack can be signalled as
          attack details.</t>

          <t><list style="hanging">

              attack description. Natural Language Processing techniques
              (e.g., word embedding) might provide some utility in mapping the
              attack description to an attack type. Textual representation of
              attack solves two problems: (a) avoids the need to create
              mapping tables manually between vendors and (b) avoids the need
              to standardize attack types which keep evolving.</t>

              <t hangText="attack-severity:">Attack severity level. This
              attribute takes one of the values defined in Section 3.12.2 of
              <xref target="RFC7970"></xref>.</t>

              <t hangText="start-time:">The time the attack started. The
              attack's start time is expressed in seconds relative to

              the leading tag 1 (epoch-based date/time) MUST be omitted.</t>

              <t hangText="end-time:">The time the attack ended. The attack
              end time is expressed in seconds relative to 1970-01-01T00:00Z

              involved in an attack and which are generating an important part

          <t>DOTS clients and servers may be provided with mappings from

          transmit telemetry data. Furthermore, it is possible that the DOTS
          client and DOTS server are provided by the same vendor, but the
          vendor mapping tables are at different revisions. The DOTS client
          SHOULD transmit telemetry information using any vendor mapping(s)
          that it provided to the DOTS server (e.g., using a POST as depicted
          in <xref target="installmap"></xref>) and the DOTS server SHOULD use

          the capability of sharing vendor attack mapping details is supported
          by the server (i.e., check the value of
          'vendor-mapping-enabled').</t>

          <t>If 'vendor-mapping-enabled' is set to 'true', A DOTS client MAY

            values MUST increase monotonically (when a new PUT is generated by
            a DOTS client to convey pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry).
            <vspace blankLines="1" />The procedure specified in Section 4.4.1

        <t>'cuid' and 'tmid' MUST NOT appear in the PUT request message

        <t>At least the 'target' attribute and another
        pre-or-ongoing-mitigation attribute (<xref target="pre"></xref>) MUST
        be present in the PUT request. If only the 'target' attribute is
        present, this request is handled as per <xref
        target="preStoC"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The relative order of two PUT requests carrying DOTS
        pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry from a DOTS client is determined
        by comparing their respective 'tmid' values. If two such requests have
        an overlapping 'target', the PUT request with higher numeric 'tmid'
        value will override the request with a lower numeric 'tmid' value. The
        overlapped lower numeric 'tmid' MUST be automatically deleted and no
        longer be available.</t>

        <t>The DOTS server indicates the result of processing a PUT request
        using CoAP Response Codes. In particular, the 2.04 (Changed) Response
        Code is returned if the DOTS server has accepted the
        pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry. The 5.03 (Service Unavailable)
        Response Code is returned if the DOTS server has erred. 5.03 uses the
        Max-Age Option to indicate the number of seconds after which to
        retry.</t>

        <t>How long a DOTS server maintains a 'tmid' as active or logs the
        enclosed telemetry information is implementation specific. Note that
        if a 'tmid&rsquo; is still active, then logging details are updated by
        the DOTS server as a function of the updates received from the peer
        DOTS client.</t>

        <t>A DOTS client that lost the state of its active 'tmid's or has to
        set 'tmid' back to zero (e.g., crash or restart) MUST send a GET
        request to the DOTS server to retrieve the list of active 'tmid'
        values. The DOTS client may then delete 'tmid's that should not be
        active anymore (<xref target="spa"></xref>). Sending a DELETE with no
        'tmid' indicates that all 'tmid's must be deactivated (<xref

        <t>The pre-or-ongoing-mitigation data (attack details, in particular)
        can also be signaled from DOTS servers to DOTS clients. For example, a
        DOTS server co-located with a DDoS detector can collect monitoring
        information from the target network, identify a DDoS attack using
        statistical analysis or deep learning techniques, and signal the
        attack details to the DOTS client.</t>

        <t>The DOTS client can use the attack details to decide whether to
        trigger a DOTS mitigation request or not. Furthermore, the security
        operations personnel at the DOTS client domain can use the attack
        details to determine the protection strategy and select the
        appropriate DOTS server for mitigating the attack.</t>

        <t>In order to receive pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry
        notifications from a DOTS server, a DOTS client MUST send a PUT
        (followed by a GET) with the target filter. An example of such a PUT
        request is shown in <xref target="put-tmid"></xref>. In order to avoid
        maintaining a long list of such requests, it is RECOMMENDED that DOTS
        clients include all targets in the same request (assuming this fits
        within one single datagram). DOTS servers may be instructed to
        restrict the number of pre-or-ongoing-mitigation requests per DOTS
        client domain. The PUT request MUST be maintained in an active state
        by the DOTS server until a delete request is received from the same
        DOTS client to clear this pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry or when
        the DOTS client is considered inactive (e.g., Section 3.5 of <xref

        <t>DOTS clients may also filter out the asynchronous notifications

        considerations (ranges, multiple values) specified for target
        attributes apply for source attributes. Special care SHOULD be taken
        when using these filters as their use may cause some attacks may be
        hidden to the requesting DOTS client (e.g., if the attack changes its

        <t>A DOTS server sends the aggregate data for a target using
        'total-attack-traffic' attribute. The aggregate assumes that Uri-Query
        filters are applied on the target. The DOTS server MAY include more
        fine-grained data when needed (that is,
        'total-attack-traffic-protocol' and 'total-attack-traffic-port'). If a
        port filter (or protocol filter) is included in a request,
        'total-attack-traffic-protocol' (or 'total-attack-traffic-port')

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t></t>

      <section anchor="sec1" title="DOTS Signal Channel Telemetry">
        <t>The security considerations for the DOTS signal channel protocol
        are discussed in Section 11 of <xref target="RFC9132"></xref>. The
        following discusses the security considerations that are specific to
        the DOTS signal channel extension defined in this document.</t>

        <t>The DOTS telemetry information includes DOTS client network
        topology, DOTS client domain pipe capacity, normal traffic baseline
        and connections capacity, and threat and mitigation information. Such
        information is sensitive; it MUST be protected at rest by the DOTS
        server domain to prevent data leakage. Note that sharing this
        sensitive data with a trusted DOTS server does not introduce any new
        significant considerations other that the need for the aforementioned
        protection. Such a DOTS server is already trusted to have access to
        that kind of information by being in the position to observe and
        mitigate attacks.</t>

        <t>DOTS clients are typically considered to be trusted devices by the
        DOTS client domain. DOTS clients may be co-located on network security
        services (e.g., firewall devices), and a compromised security service
        potentially can do a lot more damage to the network than just the DOTS
        client component. This assumption differs from the often held view
        that devices are untrusted, often referred to as the "zero-trust
        model". A compromised DOTS client can send fake DOTS telemetry data to
        a DOTS server to mislead the DOTS server. This attack can be prevented
        by monitoring and auditing DOTS clients to detect misbehavior and to
        deter misuse, and by only authorizing the DOTS client to convey DOTS
        telemetry information for specific target resources (e.g., an
        application server is authorized to exchange DOTS telemetry for its IP
        addresses but a DDoS mitigator can exchange DOTS telemetry for any
        target resource in the network). As a reminder, this is a variation of
        dealing with compromised DOTS clients as discussed in Section 11 of
        <xref target="RFC9132"></xref>.</t>

        <t>DOTS servers must be capable of defending themselves against DoS
        attacks from compromised DOTS clients. The following non-comprehensive
        list of mitigation techniques can be used by a DOTS server to handle
        misbehaving DOTS clients:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The probing rate (defined in Section 4.5 of <xref
            target="RFC9132"></xref>) can be used to limit the average data
            rate to the DOTS server.</t>

            <t>Rate-limiting DOTS telemetry, including those with new 'tmid'
            values, from the same DOTS client defends against DoS attacks that
            would result in varying the 'tmid' to exhaust DOTS server
            resources. Likewise, the DOTS server can enforce a quota and
            time-limit on the number of active pre-or-ongoing-mitigation
            telemetry data items (identified by 'tmid') from the DOTS
            client.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Note also that telemetry notification interval may be used to
        rate-limit the pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry notifications
        received by a DOTS client domain.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Vendor Attack Mapping">
        <t>The security considerations for the DOTS data channel protocol are
        discussed in Section 10 of <xref target="RFC8783"></xref>. The
        following discusses the security considerations that are specific to
        the DOTS data channel extension defined in this document.</t>

        <t>All data nodes defined in the YANG module specified in <xref
        target="data"></xref> which can be created, modified, and deleted
        (i.e., config true, which is the default) are considered sensitive.
        Write operations to these data nodes without proper protection can
        have a negative effect on network operations. Appropriate security
        measures are recommended to prevent illegitimate users from invoking
        DOTS data channel primitives as discussed in <xref
        target="RFC8783"></xref>. Nevertheless, an attacker who can access a
        DOTS client is technically capable of undertaking various attacks,
        such as: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Communicating invalid attack mapping details to the server
            ('/data-channel:dots-data/data-channel:dots-client/dots-telemetry:vendor-mapping'),
            which will mislead the server when correlating attack details.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Some of the readable data nodes in the YANG module specified in
        <xref target="data"></xref> may be considered sensitive. It is thus
        important to control read access to these data nodes. These are the
        data nodes and their sensitivity:<list style="symbols">
            <t>'/data-channel:dots-data/data-channel:dots-client/dots-telemetry:vendor-mapping'
            can be misused to infer the DDoS protection technology deployed in
            a DOTS client domain.</t>

            <t>'/data-channel:dots-data/dots-telemetry:vendor-mapping' can be
            used by a compromised DOTS client to leak the attack detection
            capabilities of the DOTS server. This is a variation of the
            compromised DOTS client attacks discussed in <xref
            target="sec1"></xref>.</t>
